# Jarvis-Assistant
Ever heard of Jarvis from the famous Marvel movies?  This mini-project is a demonstration of how Python can be used to create such amazing projects inspired by our favorite movies.

How to use it:-
At start jarvis asks you for your name, then enter your name , if your name already exists in the databse it asks you if you want to be removed from the database, if your answer is no then jarvis gives you the secret message. 
Again as its a loop, jarvis asks for your name and if your name already exists it asks you if you want to be removed from the database, if your answer is yes then jarvis removes your name from the database.
